    <h2>About Me</h2>
    Hi, I am Purity Ruddy. I am an Entriprise Integration Support analyst at Safaricom PLC. I have a degree
    in Computer science from Moi University and I am an Oracle Certified Associate. I enjoy
    deploying new applications and troubleshooting systems. Currently working with Tibco middleware.
    I have joined the academy to become a DevOps engineer as currently I am only involved in operations.
    The academy will give me an opportunity to improve on my coding skills as well as learn new technologies which will
    enable me to upskill and work more efficiently.
    My hobbies are travelling upcountry, visiting friends and family and watching investigative series.
